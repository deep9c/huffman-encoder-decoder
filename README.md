# huffman-encoder-decoder
Huffman encoder and decoder used for lossless data compression

To run the code, first execute the make file. Then execute encoder.java giving the input file path as command line argument, which will output an encoded bin file. 
Next, executing the decoder.java will decode the bin file and output the original file which was initially given as input.
